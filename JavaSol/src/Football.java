 People around the world watch football matches and root for different football
 teams. Some people are fans of Real Madrid, some like Barcelona, some pull for
 Atletico Madrid, while others do not miss a single match with FC Bayern Munich.
 The teams would like to know people in which countries cheer for them. So,
 letâ€™s help them!
 INPUT SAMPLE:
 The first argument is a path to a file. Each row includes a test case with
